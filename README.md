## 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me
I concurrently earned two bachelor’s degrees in computer engineering and electrical engineering, alongside a
master’s degree in electrical engineering, all accomplished within 6 years (2016-2023, excluding 2022). I pursued my undergraduate studies at [Tehran Polytechnic](https://aut.ac.ir/en) and continued my academic journey at [Tehran University](https://ut.ac.ir/en) for the master's degree.
