## &nbsp;About
I'm Mohammad Hossein Badiei. I have completed simultaneous honours tri-degrees (totally 5 degrees, including 2 honours, over 6 years) in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering at Tehran University and Tehran polytechnic. In 2021, I won the gold medal in the National Olympiad for Electrical Engineering. Additionally, I was awarded a full scholarship for an AI internship at Tsinghua University, China. I ranked 1st in the 6th Young Scientists Festival in Math and CS, and was recognized as a UNESCO Distinguished Young Scientist last year. I am joining the Tencent Research Institute in Shenzhen, China, as an AI Researcher, collaborating with an incredibly talented and dynamic development team on the Hunyuan generative model. My research will focus on advancing generalization and AI alignment.
